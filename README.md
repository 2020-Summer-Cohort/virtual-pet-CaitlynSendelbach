# Virtual Pet

Created Unit tests to test hunger, boredom, thirst, and sickness. Created the corresponding code in VirtualPet.java.

Created tests to test for going to the vet, feeding, playing and giving water. Wrote corresponding codes for these in VirtualPet as well.

Created the user interface and app in VirtualPetApplication.java and used a while loop to create a loop that continues until hunger, thirst or boredom get to 100 or if sickness gets to 50.

Created the VirtualPet called Rusty the dog and gave it starting variables of 5 for hunger, thirst and boredom. Printed out Rustys' information and the options the user has. I then asked for input from the user and then went into the loop.
